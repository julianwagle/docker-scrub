# docker-scrub
Bash script to wipe Docker (Containers, Images, Networks, &amp; VOLUMES!!!) USE WITH CAUTION!!!

I'm only posting it because it can be usefull - for example I cleared about 70GB of data from my computer with this script. However, if you use this script when you have a valuable volume on your computer you will lose it. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
